forward decleration - deifne the function above main but provide the body below main

### variable = a name location in memory - image houses - varaibles are the lots of land, not the house - the address points to where the lot is

stack overflow - using more memory than allocated

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int joe(void);

int main(){
    joe();
    return 0;
}

int joe(){
    printf("Hello %d", x);
}
```
